# Insurance Policy & Claims Analytics Dashboard

## 1. Project Title / Headline  
**Insurance Policy & Claims Analytics Dashboard**  
A clean, interactive Power BI dashboard built on an insurance dataset to analyze **premium, coverage, claims, policy activity (active/inactive)** and customer trends using slicers, KPIs, and drill-through insights.

---

## 2. Short Description / Purpose  
The Insurance Policy & Claims Analytics Dashboard is an interactive Power BI report designed to analyze **10,000 insurance records** stored in SQL Server. It helps users track key insurance performance metrics like **premium collection, coverage distribution, claim amount trends, claim status outcomes**, and **active vs inactive policies** for faster reporting and decision-making.

---

## 3. Tech Stack  
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:  
- Power BI Desktop – Main platform used for building the dashboard and visuals  
- Power Query Editor – Used for data profiling, cleaning, and creating derived columns  
- DAX / Aggregations – Used for KPIs, totals, counts, and dynamic filtering behavior  
- Microsoft SQL Server (Developer Edition) – Used as the primary data source for the project  
- SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio) – Used for importing the dataset and validating data using SQL queries  
- Power BI Service – Used for publishing reports, workspace creation, and sharing  
- File Format – `.pbix` for development and `.png` for dashboard previews  

---

## 4. Data Source  
**Source:** Insurance dataset imported into **Microsoft SQL Server** (flat file / CSV).  

The dataset contains **10,000 records** with policy, customer, and claim-level details such as:  
- Policy Number, Customer ID, Gender, Age, Policy Type  
- Policy Start Date, Policy End Date  
- Premium Amount, Coverage Amount  
- Claim Number, Claim Date, Claim Amount, Claim Status  

**Additional columns created in Power Query:**  
- Age Group (Young Adults / Adults / Senior)  
- Active / Inactive (based on Policy End Date logic)

## 5. Features / Highlights  

### • Business Problem  
Insurance datasets contain multiple attributes (policy type, premiums, coverage, claims, customer demographics), but without a dashboard it becomes time-consuming to answer important questions like:  
- Which policy types generate the most premium?  
- How many policies are active vs expired?  
- What is the split of claims (settled / rejected / pending)?  
- Which age segment has higher claim amounts?  
- How does coverage vary across policy types and claim outcomes?  

These insights are not easy to track quickly in raw tables.

---

### • Goal of the Dashboard  
To provide an interactive Power BI report that:  
- Shows key insurance KPIs in one place  
- Allows users to filter data by policy/customer/claim  
- Highlights claim outcome trends and policy performance  
- Enables drill-through to row-level records for validation and deeper analysis  
- Can be published to Power BI Service for sharing with others
